Work and random data analysis

Work comprehend but not limits to a few codes on simulations (gaussian beam propagation interacting with elements such as gratings and samples) and applied simulations to data reducted from raw data (e.g., CCD cameras)

Uploaded SACLA_RINKEN: a typical code for data analysis. In this case data were collected at the RINKEN X-RAY Free Electron Laser (FEL) facility in Japan. Data collecter were to prove a proof of principle of full X-rays 4-wave mixing. Data are published in Nature Communication Physics @ https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-025-02178-y.
